     "<TSv2_API_HOST>/sessions/create"
```

```javascript
// Call Rails endpoint via AJAX to apply current card layout to JSON data:

    data: jsonDeckData,
    success: function(result) {
      console.log("/doc_interface/card_layout call ok.");
      // Display resulting partial:
      $('#wherever-you-wanna-put-the-result-into').html( result );
    },
    error: function(result) {
      console.log("/doc_interface/card_layout response error!");
      // Clear the partial in case of error:
      $('#wherever-you-wanna-put-the-result-into').html('');
    },
    dataType: "html"
  });
}
//--------------------------------------------------------------------
```

> Response (200, 'text/html'):

```html
<p>
  This is a placeholder for what will be an <code>HTML snippet</code>
  obtained from rendering the current <b>card layout</b>, filled-in with
  the details of the JSON deck data payload.<br/>
  This HTML partial can be easily <i>included directly on a DIV inside a page</i>,
  or wrapped in another container in order to be displayed.<br/>
  (The actual HTML resulting code is not included here since it's too long and complex.)
</p>
```

Retrieves the rendered HTML partial that can be used to display a single Card with its contents.

The resulting Card "widget" is somehow simplified (and possibly optimized in its usage of the CSS styles).
It won't have the highlighting button or the flip button features incorporated, but it'll embed the CSS code for flipping on its sides.

To flip or display the card on the **front side**, execute the following Javascript code:

```javascript
$('.card-contents .flipper').css({transform: "rotateY(0deg)"});
```

To make it flip or display its **back side**, execute this instead:

```javascript
$('.card-contents .flipper').css({transform: "rotateY(180deg)"});
```

Currently this resource works only via XHR (AJAX) POST request, with no authentication checks.

Future versions may introduce a static token or a session authorization.

The JSON deck data (`jsonDeckData` in the Javascript example) that has to be used to populate the resulting card layout, has to be sent with the request itself as the full body of POST payload data.

Its format is the one defined by the DeckOfCards API.

In order to test entrypoint compliance with end-case scenario and any possible data throughput limit, it's possible to create a locally-run crude HTML page that tries to connect to the entrypoint to retrieve the resulting styled HTML partial of the rendered Card.

Create somewhere a `test.html` page with the code below, and include in the same directory a copy of `jquery.js`, vers. 1.12 or above, in either standard or minified form (it doesn't matter).

Then open the page with a browser and fill the form in, specifying the URL of the endpoint, filling in the Deck-of-card JSON data (even by copying & pasting the avove sample), and then issuing the request by pressing the 'submit request' button.

The current response should weight around 11.9K, with an average timing of 800 msec.
